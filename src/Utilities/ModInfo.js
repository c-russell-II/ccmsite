In addition, balance changes have been made that increase the viability of underperforming units such as the Predator, Hellion and Wraith while overperforming units such as the Siege Tank and Marine are no longer as generically powerful. The mod is specifically designed to be ran on the Nightmare Difficulty option, however the balance changes will remain if played on Casual, Normal or Hard. These difficulties are untested however and may be slightly more difficult than their Blizzard analogues. ',

NOTE As I have been unable to locate the Nstory01 map file that holds the army technology and Nova Equipment screens, the tooltips therein will not be accurate. Instead there's a Google document in the Drive link where you can find out what the changes to the equipment are.",
